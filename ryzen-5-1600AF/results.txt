There is too little RAM for these builds, even with additional 16GB swap it still triggers OOMK when there
are too many bitbake threads (like the default number of cpu threads == 12)

So the first build with the default values didn't finish as dmesg shows:

After adding 32GB swap on the same NVMe SSD, instead of 16GB on slow HDD I was able to finish
all-cores build without OOMK and it's even slightly faster than 2 bb threads build, but for
price of much more significant load during the build and ssd wear due to swap.
